# RBKSITEJULY2018

## *Things to consider:*
1. The website must be responsive (I will share with how it should look like)
2. We need to use the following technologies:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Bootstrap
- jQuery
- Any Javascript library/UIs that may help in the other dirty work so we donâ€™t need to reinvent the wheel.
3. All css code must be in style.css or in external css file, NO  inline CSS code at all.
4. I will create a repo and the main structure of the project and share it with you. Each one will have a branch and will be working on it. Finally we can merge all the code into the master.
5. Heavy documentation is required.

If you have any questions, comments please let me know.
